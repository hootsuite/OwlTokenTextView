## Development process

### Tools

Before you start you will need to install these tools:

* [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools): `gem install fastlane --verbose`
* [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint): `brew install swiftlint`

Optionally add this alias to your .zshrc or .bashrc file: `alias fl='bundle exec fastlane'`. It will save typing when running fastlane.

### After you clone for the first time

Run `bin/setup`. This will checkout and build the necessary dependencies.

### To make a change

1. Run `fl test` to make sure the unit tests pass.
2. Create a pull request and get it reviewed.
3. Merge the pull request.
4. Run `fl release` to create a new release tag with one of these options: `type:patch`, `type:minor` or `type:major`.
